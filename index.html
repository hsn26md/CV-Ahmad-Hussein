        <p class="desc">I am a 2-year gapyear student, honestly I didn't choose to take a gapyear, but my journey to pursue higher education is quite long and challenging, one of which is the blessing and support of my parents, but behind that there is an advantage, namely about several things that I have.</p>

                    <p>I became an assistant drafter engineer who uses a software, namely AutoCAD software, I taught myself for this position because in the company, the position I occupy is a new position which is equivalent to a drafter engineer, only I became an assistant because I was new and my senior did not have the skills to master the software or you could say he was still drawing manually.</p>

                    <p>I pursued this field independently and self-taught. This work arose from my passion for design. From the beginning, I designed because I loved it, and because I enjoyed harmony, aesthetics, and something different. Eventually, some of my friends recognized me as an editor, and that's where I landed some jobs. My projects include logos, t-shirt designs, and illustrations.</p>

                    <p>I attended a state Islamic high school majoring in science and my school had skills or some kind of major, and I took TBSM (Motorcycle Engineering and Business), but in fact I prefer the world of technology and design. During high school, I only studied intensively for 1 year, first because of Covid-19 and second because of the earthquake disaster, so the learning I received was not very comprehensive.</p>

                    <p>I chose to enter this campus mainly because of the scholarship, and the reason I took informatics engineering was because I wanted to try something new and I felt that I was capable of learning it, honestly, previously I really wanted to take architecture, but it was difficult for me and this was another option that I could take, with a fairly long time, namely 2 years.</p>
